CHALLENGES FACED

--OBJ Model Loading Problems
    Early on, all model files loaded as:

    Loaded Pawn.obj with 0 vertices

    This happened because:
    OBJ files were empty

    Fix:
    Replace all .obj files with proper 3D models
    Scale and rotate models correctly in the scene

--Slow Rendering Performance
    High polycount models (12k–18k vertices per piece!) combined with Python loops caused:
    -Low FPS
    -Visible lag when moving camera
    -Stuttering when drawing full board

    Temporary fixes:
    -Reduced lighting complexity
    -Simplified draw loops
    -Avoided unnecessary recalculations
    -Removed expensive transformations

--Implementing Online Multiplayer
    Adding multiplayer inside a GLUT render loop was challenging:
    -Avoid blocking calls (recv() freezes rendering)
    -Required threading for listening to network updates
    -Syncing host/client turn states
    -Ensuring both boards stay identical
    -Avoiding mismatched turns
    -Handling connection refusal & timeouts

    After fixes, LAN/local online play works with:
    -Move synchronization
    -Per-turn updates
    -Host = White, Client = Black mapping

--Large Single-File Codebas
    main.py reached 1300+ lines, making it hard to:
    -Debug
    -Maintain
    -Add features
    -Collaborate
    A modular architecture is being planned.


SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT

--Split Project Into Modules
    -This improves scalability & readability.

--Optimize 3D Models
    -Your models are extremely high poly.
    Improve performance by:
    Using Blender to reduce polygons.

--Add Animations
    -Smooth piece movement
    -Camera transitions
    -Board flip effects
    -Highlight-of-last-move
    -This greatly improves user experience.

--Improve Networking
    -Use WebSockets
    -Add matchmaking or lobby
    -Reconnect support
    -Spectator mode
